### sussexthesis package

The [`sussexthesis`](https://github.com/de84sussex/sussexthesis) package is based on Chester Ismayâ€™s [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package. The package includes a thesis template that is designed to be compatible with the submission requirements of the University of Sussex, with some additional APA formatting. The package is under active development and currently only works when knitting to pdf.
