Work through the discovr_05 tutorial by pasting the below code into the **Console** in RStudio & pressing **Enter**.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}

learnr::run_tutorial("discovr_05", package = "discovr")

```

*This tutorial is pretty long, and generally visualising data isn't something we learn by heart (or need to), but you should aim to try go through the ggplot2 section as a minimum, then ideally complete the boxplots, plotting means, and scatterplots sections (you can ignore the faceting tasks if you want to). There's also an empty code chunk for you to have a go at creating a plot from the emp_data in the worksheet for week 04.*
