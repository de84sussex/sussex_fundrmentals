### `Could not find function ".."`

This error usually occurs because the package which contains the function isn't loaded or the function isn't spelled correctly. 

#### Solutions

- Check the package is loaded with `library(package)`   

- Check the function is spelled correctly  


### `Could not find function "%>%"`

This error occurs because the `magrittr` package which contains the pipe operator %>% isn't loaded. 

#### Solutions

- Load the package with `library(magrittr)` or `library(tidyverse)`
